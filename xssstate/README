Xssstate
========
This  is  a  simple utility to get the state of the X screensaver exten‐
sion.  These states include the idle time, the screensaver state and the
time how long to wait until the screensaver should be active.

The values for the states in X can be changed using xset(1).

Turn off the screensaver:

	% xset s 0

Turn on the screensaver after 60 seconds inactivity:

	% xset s 60

Force the screensaver to be active:

	% xset s blank

For more options, see xset(1).


Example script
--------------
In  xsidle.sh is an example script how to use this for a background ser‐
vice that will control your screensaver. This  can  be  used  to  invoke
slock(1) using following command:

	% xsidle.sh slock &

This should be useful in your $HOME/.xinitrc file.

Have fun!
